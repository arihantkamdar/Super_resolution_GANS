# Super_resolution_GANS
This Repository contains the implementation  of Super Resolution Gans from Scratch including training and also the use of pretrained model of ESRGANS


For understanding the basics of the Super Resolution GANs, read the SRGAN_article.docx


For understading the training process of custom SRGANS created for this repository please go through SRGANS.ipynb files
In SRGANS we created our own model from scratch with its description in SGANS article.docx

For implementing the pre build model of SRGANS (ESRGANS) refer the code in driver_code_of_SRGANS.
the file: driver_code_of_SRAGNS used a pre trained model by tensorflow and is included just for demontraction purpose.
